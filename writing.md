### Header letter: Sentence case

Capitalize the first letter of the first word and proper nouns in headings.

**Before**

```md

```

**After**

```md

### Spell number: 1-10

Spell out one to nine and use numerals for 10 and above.

**Before**

```md

## Punctuation

### Emphasize punctuation: Always

When highlighting a word or phrase with adjacent punctuations, also highlight
the punctuations.

**Before**

```md
**Lorem ipsum**, dolor sit amet.
```

**After**

```md
**Lorem ipsum,** dolor sit amet.
```

### Punctuate list item: Only sentence

Punctuate list items with a period only if they are complete sentences.

**Before**

```md
- Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet
- Consectetur adipiscing elit

1.  Foo.
1.  Bar.
```

**After**

```md
- Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet.
- Consectetur adipiscing elit.

1.  Foo
1.  Bar
```

### Serial comma: Never

Serial comma is not placed after the penultimate term. Exceptionally, comma can
be placed when combining two separate contexts.

**Before**

```
