Use a slash to separate two or more words that are closely related. Do not put
whitespace between the slash.

Capitalize the first letter of the first word and proper nouns in headings.

## Punctuation

### Emphasize punctuation: Always

When highlighting a word or phrase with adjacent punctuations, also highlight
the punctuations.

```

```

### Punctuate list item: Only sentence

Punctuate list items only if they are more than one sentence.

**Before**

  roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
  years old

1.  Foo.

```

**After**

Serial comma is not placed after the penultimate term. Exceptionally, comma can
be placed when combining two separate contexts.
