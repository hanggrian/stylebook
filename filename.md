# Filename format

### Extension letter: Lowercase

Refer to file type names as uppercase, but use lowercase for file extensions.

Use full form file extensions (e.g.: `.jpeg` over `.jpg`), unless modified by a
specific platform or tool.

```plaintext
beautiful_landscape.jpeg

company_profile.pdf
```

### Separate indices: Except first

When referencing a series of files, use a combination of the filename and index
without a separator.

```plaintext
document1.html

section2_1.md
```

### Whitespace symbol: Underscore

Use an underscore to separate words in a file name. Although hypens are more
common, it is sometimes used to denote a range of values in a file name.

This rule can be ignored if a specific platform or tool already has a naming
convention.

```plaintext
avoiding_cliches.jd

quick_lesson1-4.md
```
