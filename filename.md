# Filename format

## Separator: Underscore

[![Rationale](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google-Filenames-4285f4)](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames/#exceptions-for-consistency)

Use an underscore to separate words in a file name. Although hypens are more
common, it is sometimes used to denote a range of values in a file name.

This rule can be ignored if a specific platform or tool already has a naming
convention.

avoiding_cliches.jd

```

## Extension: Lowercase

[![Rationale](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google-Extensions-4285f4)](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames/#file-type-names)

Refer to file type names as uppercase, but use lowercase for file extensions.

Use full form file extensions (e.g.: `.jpeg` over `.jpg`), unless modified by a
specific platform or tool.

```plaintext
beautiful_landscape.jpeg

company_profile.pdf
```

## Indexing: Combine

When referencing a series of files, use a combination of the filename and index
without a separator.

```plaintext
document1.html

assignment2.md
```
